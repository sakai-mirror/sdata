	/**
	 * <p>
	 * The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
	 * entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a
	 * data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned
	 * as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process,
	 * unless that text happens to be the output of the process.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the
	 * request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
	 * If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET
	 * method requests that the entity be transferred only under the
	 * circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The
	 * conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by
	 * allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple
	 * requests or transferring data already held by the client.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET" if the request
	 * message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests that only
	 * part of the entity be transferred, as described in section <a rel="xref"
	 * href="rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35">14.35</a>. The partial GET method is
	 * intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing
	 * partially-retrieved entities to be completed without transferring data
	 * already held by the client.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets the
	 * requirements for HTTP caching described in section 13.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * See section <a
	 * href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec15.html#sec15.1.3">15.1.3</a>
	 * for security considerations when used for forms.

	 * <p>
	 * The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT
	 * return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained in
	 * the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the

	 * The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the

	 * resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version
	 * of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not
	 * point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined
	 * as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can
	 * create the resource with that URI. If a new resource is created, the
	 * origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created) response.
	 * If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No
	 * Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion
	 * of the request. If the resource could not be created or modified with the
	 * Request-URI, an appropriate error response SHOULD be given that reflects
	 * the nature of the problem. The recipient of the entity MUST NOT ignore
	 * any Content-* (e.g. Content-Range) headers that it does not understand or
	 * implement and MUST return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one
	 * or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as
	 * stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected
	 * in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request
	 * identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That
	 * resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other
	 * protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the
	 * URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request --
	 * the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt
	 * to apply the request to some other resource. If the server desires that
	 * the request be applied to a different URI,
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent MAY then
	 * make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the request.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For example,
	 * an article might have a URI for identifying "the current version" which
	 * is separate from the URI identifying each particular version. In this
	 * case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in several other URIs
	 * being defined by the origin server.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin
	 * server.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * PUT requests MUST obey the message transmission requirements set out in
	 * section 8.2.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the
	 * entity-headers in the PUT request SHOULD be applied to the resource
	 * created or modified by the PUT.
